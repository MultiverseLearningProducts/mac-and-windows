<!--TASK: Design a page that marks up some content, and will display information about Mac and Windows Laptops as follows:

Create two <div> elements in your page. One for Mac and one for Windows:

Create one <div> with id="mac" and one <div> with id="windows"

Give each <div> a class of "laptops"

For each <div> include:

<h1> tag of your choice to grab the users attention to the Mac or Windows <div>

Include 3 Images of Mac Laptops or Windows Laptops (depending on your section) and include them within their own <div> Elements.

Include a <p> element under each image describing the image.

Include an <ol> element of the top 3 laptops (depending on your <div>)

Include an <ul> element with 3 prices of your laptops 

These prices could be based on a real product or could be made up

Include an <a> tag to Apple's Website or Microsoft Website (depending on the <div> youâ€™re working on.)

Commit and push your final work back to GitHub!-->
